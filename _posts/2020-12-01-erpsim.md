Decide what information in the ERPSim console is important, and when, how and where to display it better.

What: Specific units of information within the interface.
Where: The position of each unit relative to other units and the overall structure (groups, hierarchies).
When: At what point in the sequence of use (stages).
How: Qualitative factors of information units.
Important: Consensual judgment about relevance and coherence, and the subsequent choice (after reflection and discussion).

Simplify first time usage (ease of learning and adoption).
Improve in-game debriefing.
Update to current usability patterns
Prepare the interface for incremental improvement.

Modifying the ERPsim console structure, order, content and visual layout could bring better learnability for trainers, increased levels of engagement for students and a general higher perception of quality.
